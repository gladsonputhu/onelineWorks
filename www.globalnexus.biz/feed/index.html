				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A very important aspect of the corporate world is its connecting with new people in different fields from the industry.</p>
<p>With digitalization, talking to people and starting the conversation’s essential is no more a physical interaction but just a smart device and social presence. This community of friends that you build comes in handy during chaotic situations and can actually help you a lot.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>ecently, a summit was to be organized at a college. It required an all-tech and business-oriented theme, to welcome an environment where potential graduates can connect, find opportunities and seek guidance. Under the highlights was the ‘talk’ sessions, which is actually a very good opportunity to start a talk with the professionals invited at the occasion and further resolve queries to related topics which may help one establish a good relation with that individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event promised a total of 6 talks. Although the resource people who were to be present at the event for line up talks and discussions were decided before-handed, it was our responsibility to look over the present numbers and status of the event.</p>
<p>The whole situation became difficult when one of these people decided to cut us off last minute.</p>
<p>He didn’t show up and didn’t even notify till the morning of the event. With a claim of having the line up of such talks all over the posters and flexes, the itinerary, all distributed and uploaded, it was a very harsh situation.</p>
<p>Being ready with contingency to prevent such situations is always recommended, but here particularly monetary support was not he solution. Bringing a new person and convincing them to fly to the location on such a short notice was near to impossible. In such hurry and downfall, often the concentration is diverted to fixing the problem rather than the ongoing business around.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as the time begun to approach, we also had to hold a good excuse for unavailability of the speaker everyone was expecting which pretty sure was even unclear on our side of public.</p>
<p>This was when my previous connections came to our rescue. The person who was quite a friend of mine, from the last event that attended to the time I connected with him on LinkedIn, has been talking to me, put up a post with a nearby location.</p>
<p>I set a time for an urgent call, talked directly (which shows the surety on my part) and was all upfront about the ongoing situation. A little request and trust worthy tone made our day and my friend was no less than a ‘superman without a cape’ for us.</p>
<p>The day was saved by our&nbsp;<strong>Connections. </strong>Shows your own presence in the industry and also other linking industries. Now, this friend was not from the similar business but actually into business analytics field, mentoring students and young entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>For any help and end moment stress relieve, it’s our very own people which help. Everyone is present there to help whatever is in their control. Social entrepreneurs are working for a cause over business, actually professing themselves as a campus, seek to help out.</p>
<p>Similarly, in another situation to get a validation from a particular type of organization, it took me just few messages to get a pass on the ’travel and wait in line task’.</p>
<p>The whole chaos created a huge mess and stress for all, but at the end of the day it was a successful show with the same numbers of promised speakers and interactive area which were the two important units. Participation was huge and we surely were relief after finding an alternative to what was going to happen.</p>
<p>Go as creative as you go in the theme and combination’s discussions. Run your mind and find the best solution with less capital and expected returns. But here again, databases’ familiarity&nbsp; is a very important factor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stretch of shutdown has been a big rundown on the events industry. As the people around the globe sit inside waiting for all this to end, organizations are exhausted of delaying the pending items on their agenda and don’t want the essential work to be held back anymore.</p>
<p>As different industries are coming together to make things run and bring the best that they can from this quarantine situation, everyone is looking up to the online web services and cloud facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Hosts and Audience</strong></p>
<p>As everyone is inside their home, people are finding ways to make it a productive time. They all are exploring the net for any upcoming event they can attend and engage while sitting on their couch. Use these factors to your advantage, engage people through advertising at most visited online platforms. Binge watching at entertainment website is a guilty pleasure, where people can be targeted for gaining knowledge through your online event. They are also most visited websites which help you capture a bigger crowd.</p>
<p>Equally, the industries’ resource people are also under lockdown and hence can be invited and pitched easily to join the event and maybe give a talk or host a conference.</p>
<p><strong>Registrations and Invites </strong></p>
<p>With everything being online even before the pandemic, registration is not a big problem during this time. If you had no time to switch to online booking and registration, you can start with an open source software to make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Bookwhen</strong> prides itself on “slashing your admin time.” It strives for that by providing a clean, easy-to-navigate interface that can have you logged in and setting up an event page in minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Brushfire</strong> provides a “powerful sales and management tool alongside outstanding service and support to give you the very best event management tool.”Users have the flexibility to control pricing, fees, advertising, and communication for their event.</p>
<p>Remember to keep certain things in mind while thinking of marketing the event online. Keep yourself in attendees’ shoes. The patience level of a general person is quite reduced online and due to repetitiveness of random advertisements on various sites, the user often has an impulsive approach of skipping it. Make it simple, appealing and full of excitement. Keeping it short and informative enough will help you increase engagement.</p>
<p>Online database management requires a little familiarising and prerequisite experience with such a software. But keeping the logs and information on cloud would be the best way of preserving your hard work for future reference during this time. It also helps you manage registration process in a hassle-freeway.</p>
<p><strong>Konfeo</strong> is an online event registration software which enables you to quickly create an event, customize registration form and sell tickets or seats.</p>
<p><strong>The Signup Place</strong> A fully functional online signup sheet system with many features: groups, tables, different reminders, scheduling, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Plan the event </strong></p>
<p>There are some basic goals that you want to meet when taking any event online:</p>
<p>• Flexible and Customizable Registration<br />
• Automated Event Confirmation &amp; Email Communication<br />
• Virtual Event Simulating Physical Event<br />
• Comprehensive Reporting on an Event Platform</p>
<p><strong>Create Virtual Networking space</strong>, providing an event space where each speaker or audience can have deep chat regarding specific topics. Having individual rooms or tables for business meet-up or discussion groups besides the main stage. Creating private rooms for group discussions and having break rooms is also a part of the same concept.</p>
<p><strong>Design Virtual booths and expo area</strong>, help the companies in building their own place and in making it visually appealing. Make them record their pitch and introduction along with a basic information brochure which can be downloaded by those who are interested in their product or services they provide.</p>
<p><strong>Organise Webinars</strong>, speaker or panellists sharing on specific topics which audiences are aiming for market insight or contents that they are interested in. Chatting, Q&amp;A or polling features allow speaker-audience interaction and exchanging opinions. Let them have the control of the flow of their discussion while you provide assistance if they get stuck or anything happens. Have instant stage floor connection and a prepared itinerary for it to function smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Having easy tabs like Event reception, Event talks, Event expos, Event booths and Event networking and customizing them according to your need can also be very helpful and also easy to get along for the attendees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Virtual Events are very common and easy to organise nowadays. Fortnite had announced its virtual concert with Travis Scott, playing with their ongoing theme of Astronomical adventures through his album Astro world.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
The strong marketing by Rubrik for their Forward digital summit on well-known platforms like Youtube&nbsp; was quite engaging for online event like theirs’s.</p>
<p>Come up with a compelling environment, similar to that of simulation virtual world games. Keep it interactive and easy to navigate through.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You don&#8217;t marry the person you can live with—you marry the person you can&#8217;t live without.”</p>
<p>The pandemic extending its grip over more and more people every day, families no more want to wait for all of this to end. Nobody would have expected that the cut-down on the budget of lavish Indian weddings would be in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a growing trend of online weddings or <strong>E-Weddings</strong> across the nation as the auspicious days or wedding season of the year approaches.</p>
<p>We not only witnessed but had this splendid opportunity to organise and plan such a wedding on the 26th of April 2020. The E-Wedding started around 11 am and both the families participated in the ceremony with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A digital invitation card was designed for the screening of the occasion and greetings were exchanged as hosts to commence the wedding. The guests were welcomed by the girl’s parents just like at any wedding. A video was prepared to show the journey of the couple-to-be, bride and bridegroom. The relatives were entertained with classic wedding jams to add the zing in the celebrations. The melodies turned in favour of one side as the bridegroom made his entry. The extravaganza was filled with bliss as the beautiful bride made her way to the online gathering.</p>
<p>The whole idea was to create an online simulation of the actual wedding, holding onto the essence of the actual thing and also making it easy to get along with it through proper planning and organising.</p>
<p>As both the families rejoiced, the parents, bride and groom along with the panditji were preparing to carry on the traditions and rituals for the day. Jaimala was carried out while the attendees from both the sides wished a blessed future for the couple who were starting a new chapter of their life. The control of the ongoing online event was given to the panditji for carrying out the procedures.</p>
<p>Regular ululations were being made to respect Bengali Traditions from the groom’s side. All the guests blessed the newly wed and communicated as the video call was muted. The host cordially congratulated everyone for the new relations that were build up and also the graceful couple and parents. The couple enjoyed their special moment and the audience had a great time while they both performed on bhangra beats. Bedai, an emotional moment, was seized with the music as the couple exited the scene.</p>
<p>The whole day was quite refreshing and heart-warming as the two souls intertwined, breaking the ropes of the ‘conventional ways’ and tied knots to a lifelong commitment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The creativity and imagination are two words that carry endless along with them.</p>
<p>The event planning is a very crucial process. From the venue to theme to engagement campaigns, it all revolves around what people want. Let’s see how can we attract the eyes of the sweetest.</p>
<p>A revamped way of event can be by any means. Through marketing campaigns or through new ways of conducting various activities during the event or even by getting back to attendees after the event.</p>
<p>The DÉCOR takes up the main part of conveying the event of the whole event. Professional meets minimalist while Casual meets Fun and Royal meets chic.</p>
<p>• Large keywords, letters sculptures and use of similar catchphrase makes people remember.<br />
Social media engagement is quite important. This helps people post about the event helping in attraction of more audience and spectators.&nbsp;Also, they offer as a good photo ap!</p>
<p>• Coffee talks and short extempore on a casual evening can be made a part of a formal meeting. Make professional a little casual to let people adjust and feel comfortable enough to form an environment for socializing.</p>
<p>• Connections and expansion of reach in corporate world is as important to your attendees as it is to you. Show off your social media handles and put up the hashtag for the event for people to use that. Look forward to creating trends that reach people and backtrack to your organisation.</p>
<p>The “Coachella for Geeks”, annual Collision tech conference is not only trending as a tech arena but the gathering with a perfect gender ratio and hence is promoting women in tech due to such stats.</p>
<p>PRESENTATION of the main idea behind the event is very important.</p>
<p>• Expand your branches by including people from different industries and linking the main stream to them and showing the importance of the very same thing.</p>
<p>The same goes for the line up of activities. A company’s rebranding can go to formation of new department. The whole consideration must go into making it all not so boring but fun, engaging and informative.</p>
<p>• Challenges within the people working together generates the energy level of top level. Activities like scavenger hunt for business clues which include people going around the area is a very good alternative to a boring fest tour.</p>
<p>The Staples Sales Conference used a fun, competitive challenge to educate—and reassure—employees after a company restructuring. It attracted a total audience of around 5000, 4000 present physically and 1000 remotely.</p>
<p>INNOVATE around your plan. Sketch a very basic idea of the event, just like any other basic one would be, then make new changes around selected areas.</p>
<p>• Even a tech event can have concerts and even cultural fests can have tech workshops. It’s all about what’s trending among the people.</p>
<p>Try making people familiar with the event and let them become comfortable in the zone.</p>
<p>• Promote group activities to help people work together and know each other. Take suggestions, run an innovation drive to let people think creatively and build a healthy competition spirit.</p>
<p>Google I/O developer conference is everything more than just a code fest. It celebrates the community of developers in fest-style. They portrayed the beautiful dimension that comes forward when technology and culture intertwine. Magic shows, tattoo studios and snack shacks are probably the last thing that come to your mind when talking of such an event. Well, think differently then because apparently now this is how we code.</p>
<p>A CAUSE can go a long way. From more audience to grabbing larger media attention, if successful, it can get you more or less everything you want.</p>
<p>• Invitation to key note speakers and mentors to address an audience on a moral subject gets to most of the people. Seeking support from well recognised organisations becomes easier and the audience sect become bigger.<br />
• From motivational coffee cups to cause-related merchandise stalls are all a creative approach to let people remember the great time that they had.<br />
• Follow-up with people for coming together for similar events that you organise. The base audience for such events is quite similar and hence basic number of attendees gets assured for future.</p>
<p>Organisers atsixth annual Emerge Americas executed their new layout by placing start-up booths at the center of the floor, then crisscrossed the venue with large-scale, digital activations and hence kept it both as a conference and trade show.</p>
<p>Be UNIQUE to spark that love at first sight.</p>
<p>• Adapt ideas that are focus on small details to avoid taking a big risk. Let the basic format be same but with a twist. ID cards with ‘What I inspire to be&#8217; or just LinkedIn QR codes rather the same old name and contact is what helps people start a talk.<br />
• Rather than a big LED screen with names and lines that are easily ignored by all, try putting up pie charts and big numbers.<br />
• Welcoming innovators and new ideas are very important and helps in further development of methods and organisational activities.<br />
• Open mics and outdoor group talk and boardroom simulation are all a very innovative ways of verbal communication.<br />
• Digital Graffiti and the impractical ideation wall help add the features which actually show people engaging, thinking and expressing their views in any aspect</p>
<p>IBM’s annual conference IBM THINK used their own technology to grow interaction between people and were live on 26 different channels. The A.I moment during question answer round between supercomputer and human that concluded after a long fruitful debate became a memorable site.</p>
<p>The world is full of endless possibilities, different is just another word. Putting together something that would provoke people to think again and let the mind bring forth ideas different from others is the concept that one must follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a blogger, this one is not a very biased blog for my audience but I would really shout-out to my Engineer mates.</p>
<p>This undergraduate program is not just a degree but a journey. Obviously, between the whole trauma of lectures and practical, there is a lot more to it. In the college we learn to communicate, profess and organise in one way or the other.</p>
<p>There are many events and fests happening in every other tech college. From E-summits to Cultural nights, there is a lot happening behind the curtains. As B.Tech students, our courses also involve various topics and knowledge that actually are very helpful in organizing and planning everything out.</p>
<p>PR work and various other <strong>communication</strong> skills come into play during the college fests and are actually briefed to us by our seniors who have been doing this work before. It’s actually like skills which are being passed down every tenure. Even ‘<strong>Technical communication</strong>’ as a course in early years of our study help out in this section.</p>
<p>The communication and redeeming the convincing power within you to talk to key note speakers and inviting them over to attend the events being organised actually takes one back to the basics learnt in these classes and the end-sem presentation that has to be given. This might sound like a load to those of you who are currently studying but would really help out further in life. Until then, you all have to bear the load!</p>
<p>Bachelors of technology, as the name suggests, helped me realise how technology can actually make an ongoing event less stressful. Use of voice assistant, <strong>AR based</strong> games and interactive poll <strong>designing</strong> workshops are few attractive go-to. They are quite engaging and fascinating for the spectators.</p>
<p><strong>Pitching</strong> project ideas and the whole boardroom simulation are some of the part which have actually helped in surviving the part where the basic sketched out plan is to be explained to others.</p>
<p>The <strong>online marketing campaign</strong> is what colleges have really adopted nowadays. The event scale in such universities have grown drastically so have their methods. Dedicated groups for people with particular skills work around the year to add successful events every year. All this brings out the very importance of community building within colleagues and <strong>team management</strong> and the way work distribution can come in hand.</p>
<p>Applications like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slack</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chanty</span> are great corporate applications for communication between team members and circulating important notices.</p>
<p>Importance of <strong>Database</strong> and working with it is very important. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Microsoft excel</span> is a very underrated application which is often taken for granted but is actually very powerful application for data management and analysis. The whole research and audience analysis are made very easy with couple of algorithms and bringing out the relation between different metrics in the databases.</p>
<p>A very famous sayings by seniors around always went like, “Making people pay the bills, give their money, that is an art and very hard”. Different temperament, tone and interest decide the way you talk to different people.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>pre-event budgeting</strong> and <strong>fund planning</strong> is something everyone does during their college life. Making the best out of whatever monthly budget you have by finding the right food stall to the general store which gives seasonal offers has travelled a long journey to finding cheaper décor and lighting services in the vicinity for an event.<br />
The race to be up to date with ongoing skills and new kits in tech world is similar to following the trends that are taking the lead in the marketing.</p>
<p>Self-motivation, keen observation and good perception is what are very much required as an event organiser along with the very important skill of being well organised.</p>
<p>Time management and handling takes up the biggest part of our professional life and has been a part of the college life too. Behind the long assignment submission and file work that was allotted, understanding value of proper distribution of time is how a timeline for execution is created. All the efforts put behind an event and hard work done shows only if proper audience is targeted and brought in. Networking is a phase that starts from the college itself. Connecting, not only on social media, not only with your friends, but with personalities specialising in the field of their interest, is the key here.</p>
<p><strong>Event Engineer</strong> is actually a job prospect for those who aspire to focus in this area. They are actually responsible for all the strategic background of the event.</p>
<p>• Designing and sound setups.<br />
• Completing risk assessments and security-checks.<br />
• Track all the inventories for useful resources.</p>
<p>This domain is increasing number of opportunities available with demand in attention to small details and has grown as big firms to complete tasks and make an event what it was planned to be.</p>
<p>The goal of everyday event planner maybe to make the event ‘different’ but as engineers our vision of a successful event is the ‘different’ version, that even after the event attendees think about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>COVID-19- virus spreading disease and the global pandemic, as per WHO, the event industry has taken a serious hit. The first quarter budget quotes of all the companies have collapsed due to increase in the fear of crowding up among everyone.</p>
<p>Standard advice for event organisers lies in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the SOS checklist and in making risk assessments</strong></span>, which must be ready with convincing sound of the recommendationthat eventsmust be planned by considering the crowd density.</p>
<p>Keeping <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>account of the nature of interaction</strong></span> between participants, including the layout of meeting venues.</p>
<p>Every attendee must be<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> registered with proper and currently essential information</strong></span> like mention of any travel history in recent past or if of elderly age group, therefore making it easy to locate anyone that must be diagnosed after the event concludes, if necessary, for public health reasons; their profession and related possible exposure risk.</p>
<p>• Keep the registration database ready to reach and easy to modify on leading event planning software that facilitates event setup, cloud-based storage and management such as <strong>GEVME</strong>.</p>
<p>In such times, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>communication is very important</strong></span> and it’s equally important that in a time of uncertainty about what the virus could mean, you keep all event stakeholders up to date with where you are. Manage your finances to the best for the longest period of time without breaking down.</p>
<p>There are many events which can’t be remoulded, like dinner celebrations or food exhibition, but there still lies a ton of opportunity in other event formats. One must realise the events that were already signed are all piling up for the day condition gets better. To lighten up what all is on your plate, you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>divide events which can go online and can be conducted via web interaction.</strong></span></p>
<p>• Consult your client and prepare an effective pitch to convince them to take the offer. You may negotiate on some monetary or service-based factor to make it. Something is always better than anything, right?<br />
For events like online conferences or product launch, every platform that you select for various aspect of event procedure must be well circulated and known. Don’t keep a tight schedule and give space for technical glitches and confusion that may arise.</p>
<p>• <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Registration process must be done on a platform with valid payment service and easy to use interface</strong></span>. You can facilitate this step on your own event website which will not only save you some work but in a way is more reliable and increases traffic on your portal.</p>
<p>• For the showtime, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>coordinate with hosts</strong></span> and those who will be there to present during different segments. Make sure they are confident about their part and connection, rehearse with them as this might be new for many.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This idea may work better in a corporate setting</strong></span> due to their existing working systems also being online. Many video-calling and hosting apps like <strong>ZOOM, Skype</strong> etc are in use already to engage such type of audience.</p>
<p>• <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Keep your tech guys ready</strong></span> and connecting and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>networking</strong></span> can be done through social media, which you may keep as an activity. Ask attendees and eminent personalities to share their handles at the end of the whole stream.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Incorporating VR</strong></span> is a factor which can be given keen attention to right now. Introducing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Virtual Events</strong></span> can really trend right now with lockdowns in several cities. Marketing through campaigns related to same ethos can actually work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Launching your applications</strong></span> or website cannot be done during a better period. With online engagement increasing every other day due to quarantine activity in many major hubs of the world, you can attract crowd through previously discussed campaign mottos.</p>
<p>Such Event management application can help you communicate with attendees effectively. You can use pre-scheduled emails, email alerts and if you have a live app already that people are using, you can push notifications through it.</p>
<p>Event website is another area that will be key in communicating effectively with attendees. You can use it as a main signposting point.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nominate a key person</strong></span> in the team to monitor government guidance on COVID-19. Aware your attendees about the precautions they must take and the services being provided by the organisers to ensure safety and well-being of the guests.</p>
<p>Designing event spaces and timings in such a way that crowd is reduced and managed, as in within arrival and departure areas adds up to precautionary measures taken on your part. Think and plan out around the points like how to minimise congestion, avoiding peak times on public transportand where possible, implement options for virtual (or partly virtual) participation (live streams).</p>
<p>Everyone should be aware to a sufficient amount, essential to take care of oneself and prevent spreading of the virus. Be an informed being and prevent underestimating such diseases for your own and people’s well-being too.</p>

<p>With many events’ particulars within our hands and increase in digital reachability, audience has a wide variety of events to choose from. What gets to them, is appealing to them and actually shines to hold them as confirmed attendees is the ‘innovative input’ that the event has incorporated.</p>
<p>Fascinating and catchy ideas are formulated to actually to pitch the whole event. Even similar events can have drastically different impact over people. It all lies in using new tools and methods to bring attention to the concept.</p>
<p><strong>EVENT TECHNOLOGY</strong>:</p>
<p>Integrated services and digitalisation have revolutionised the whole market. Tech savvy people are not only limited to the very domain of ‘tech’ but have used their expertise to device algorithms to devise the most suitable financial and marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Using VR oriented videos and giving up the boring presentations surely takes it to another level. Connecting remote audience and making them a part exposes them to the technological development and further attracts crowd.</p>
<p>Voice assistance and “If, then” questioning through audience is another method to use AI tool.</p>
<p><strong>EVENT EXPERIENCE AND DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>The marketing and publicity in any lavish event are spread on different levels and so is the investment in this process. The underlying flow of ideas is actually to make the event user friendly and help solve different difficulties faced by people.</p>
<p>Irrespective of event format, let it be a mindful session. Discussing some useful and relaxing thoughts actually makes the whole time put in very useful.</p>
<p>While experience must be as soothing and useful as explained, the design should be something unexpected out of the everyday expected events. A little twist and turn, here and there, goes a long way.</p>
<p>Actually, interesting people in enrolling into the event for their own development as an individual take it up the notch.</p>
<p>Hosting volunteer activities and involving sponsors gives everyone a fun time to enjoy and building some good PR for themselves is an add-on. For example, try to capture the kid in them through various nostalgic treats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Experience Design simply equates to engagement. Maintaining proper conduct, ensuring security and building a healthy environment during the event and it’s promise beforehand forms an inter- personal sense of trust.</p>
<p>It’s not only about entertaining people, it’s about keeping them focused on a particular thematic message. The five senses are not the limit anymore.</p>
<p>Ideas like CONFEX, which is part conference and a part exhibition related to a similar cause or topic is something different if thought about.</p>
<p>IMMERSIVE while relates to theatre but is actually an adopted method for people to enact different branches and personalities in the existing industry.</p>
<p>Something new may not appear to be serving the basic streamlined purpose but a smart idea can be in-depth creative.</p>
<ul>
<li>A corporate poem performance</li>
</ul>
<p>A poem created from parts written by hundreds of Astellas employees was created and was collected into one grand story by the poet LionHeart. Such activity shows how creative skills and team efforts and management can be mixed to give a promoting result.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANCE OF THEMING</strong></p>
<p>Styling and decor are more than the physical and connect emotions. They set the scene and become the first stage in driving attendee behavior and give off the right and memorable atmosphere. Planning out everything based on a basic theme gives the tangible idea a shape.</p>
<p>The whole design should be made to encourage networking.</p>
<p>Local or abstract art work for the upcoming social media generation helps promote the location as well as further attracts people to attend.</p>
<p><strong>Color dynamics</strong> and <strong>visual appeal </strong>may be very underrated aspect of event planning, but setting the correct tone for any event is as important as the actual event itself.</p>
<p><strong>STORYTELLING</strong>: Capturing the soft side of the people through sharing your own experience or any moral journey which they talk about, builds a soft corner within the audience and help them connect and relate to the situation discussed.</p>
<p><strong>HYBRID EVENTS</strong>: Niching is a popular way of personalizing an approach to attendees, including subject matter, so overlapping is inevitable. It serves to a broad-spectrum audience and more of those interested have the first motive of interacting with everyone around.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLORATION</strong>: To know a destination does not have to be forced for clients or guests. Whether they are visiting for a conference or an incentive trip, guests are eager to learn about the city around them.</p>
<p>Taking notes and using your experience as the last-minute <strong>confidence boosters help an organiser understanding and avoiding similar mistakes in the event</strong>.</p>
<p>Maximizing involvement and retention of attendees as active participants in any type of event is very important. The whole sport <strong>of ‘participation’ and willingness to put in efforts</strong> measure the success rates of an event.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK FORMULA</strong>: Taking the views of attendees not only makes up for your database but creates a way to show validation to these people and make them the ruler of the whole event, which is more or less the truth,</p>
<p><em>The attendees are surely the one crowned and for whom all the arrangements are done.</em></p>
<p>As one of <a href="http://www.globalnexus.biz/">top 10 event management company in Delhi</a>, Global Nexus has carved a niche for itself with specialization in multiple events like event management, corporate planning, organizing conferences, exhibitions, planning trade shows etc.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8486 aligncenter" src="http://www.globalnexus.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Event-tips.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="340" srcset="https://www.globalnexus.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Event-tips.jpg 453w, https://www.globalnexus.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Event-tips-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>All the stages of organising an event and making it a success take a lot of work. Here are some tips coming your way to help you out and make the process more fun.</p>
<p>You know your main focus is the audience. Everything, from the theme to main goal of the setting revolves around them.</p>
<p>Hence it is very important to <u>ANALYSE THE AUDIENCE.</u></p>
<p>From estimation of footfall to nature of attendees, the whole analysis adds up to the planning out further steps. The way an audience is to be captured and the addressing-content must be relevant and engaging for the particular crowd. Become familiar with the kind of database you are dealing with beforehand.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to an auction? It is obviously not like any yard sale but a professional kind of event. The brief at the opening of event is short as the event is all about the punctuality. A similar kind of wave is maintained throughout the session. Small talks keeping the audience engaged help in maintaining little pauses for intermission but doesn’t break the flow.</p>
<p>What goes when and where, when you have a basic idea and sketching the skeletal structure of the very thing is necessary to avoid last moment drops. Here, <u>STRATEGIC PLANNING</u> comes into play.</p>
<p>For formulating the formal itinerary, the event line up must be co-dependent, according to the nature of individual events.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Budgeting phase comes next. After you have a rough idea to work upon you need estimated capital to be invested according to the scale of event. Budgeting on different basis and dividing the funds percentage wise in the very beginning is actually a better alternative to writing down fixed numbers. Also, keeping in mind about the slip downs that may happen during the event and it’s planning, some emergency percentage must be retained to cover the damages.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Contingency plays a very important role in damage control that we were taking about. Idealistic planning set aside, one must be prepared for any adverse condition to avoid any panic and uncontrolled situation. A plan B does no harm to anyone!</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Safety planning and precautions are a major factor deciding the number of eminent personalities that show up at your event. Any carelessness in this domain can take your market from a 100 to 0 immediately, effecting the brand as a whole to be clear.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Here comes the last step of connecting dots. Now you take up meeting to spread the word and involve people as a team to work for the already presented plan. Also, never hesitate in taking second opinions and suggestions from others working towards same cause or with past experience of similar kind.</p>
<p>Make it exciting. Maintaining team work and dedication towards work for long is as difficult as concentrating for a considerate period. <u>TEAM MANAGEMENT</u> and its aspects are what makes it better and helps you improve with time.</p>
<p>Mid-event organising work, small team activities and fun time is much relevant and important to maintain useful output. Letting fellow mates to take over for a day and letting them give their inputs makes them feel a part of the event as an important entity.</p>
<p>‘Innovative Thinking’ only happens in a creative and healthy environment.</p>
<p>“To satisfy the potential attendees, the ones working towards the event, must feel good about it, enough to pitch the event with all their true hearts and interest.”</p>
<p>Take accountability of work as a manager of the team, rather than bossing around. Give them credit and communicate to resolve any internal issues or difficulties faced by anyone. Caring about everyone working around you is very important for them to take you seriously and completing the tasks in hand.</p>
<p>Whatsoever happens stick to the clear <u>PURPOSE.</u></p>
<p>Never deviate from the actual goal of event. The theme and work must be focused around a single point. You must remember to incorporate the similar essence to every part of the event and showing your partners the idea clearly. It is also linked to the kind of event associates and sponsors that you must approach.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are mentors that guide the organisers in the field to which the whole agenda is related. They help in navigating the way through technical and informative difficulties faced and also help forming a strong stand for showcasing the seriousness of an event. They often become the marketing face and help grow the reachability towards legitimate crowd.</p>
<p>Such setups must not be limited to the final purpose only but also have <u>SHORT TERM GOALS </u>of its own.&nbsp; While the main purpose still holds the upper tier on the priority list, but maintaining some smaller ‘smart’ goals are very important. Figuring out the different ways in which the event can change, find opportunities to benefit from, as an organisation as well as personally.</p>
<p>Many live and rage events are a great way to advertise your brand to grab many more customers. Concerts and events, if well organised, often have crowd that takes your reviews to another level and help you fight the hard competition out there.</p>
<p>Create a public poll, for say, to gather feedback on your event.</p>
<p>Take creative ideas from people themselves for future references. Connect with useful people and never forget to capture the success of the event/campaign that you build by clicking photographs and through videography, keep factual log for documentation purposes. Try using social media to publicise the event and getting more eyes to watch, trend the event with small activities and extending involvement through social media handles which is very helpful in increasing social media growth.</p>
<p>Use hashtags, live stream and posting after movies are a few examples out of the big list of many innovative ways of marketing.</p>
<p>Global Nexus is one of the best <a href="http://www.globalnexus.biz/">event organizer in Delhi ncr</a>. If you are looking for an event organizer in Delhi to organize events with VOW factor, look no further.</p>

<p>Devising an ideal iteration for an event is actually what gets to the organisers while the whole thing revolves around the question, “What increases the involvement of the attendees?”.</p>
<p><strong>GROWING ONLINE</strong></p>
<p>The audience has evolved through years, to the digital era and more sophisticated critical thinkers, which calls for change in our methods too.</p>
<p>Its no longer about meetings and discussions, <strong>webinars</strong> are the new way of connecting the event globally and crossing overseas to increase involvement and reaching out to new audience. Talking of reachability, using internet tools to actually create an interactive environment is a very healthy way of making an event successful and creating base attendees for future events and self-promotion.</p>
<p>For instance, Agenda based discussions have graduated to streaming sessions which can be attended even after the actual broadcast for those who couldn’t be a part at the scheduled timing, which is a two-way relaxation for both the host and the watcher.</p>
<p><strong>CONNECTING PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>An event is not only about different activities but is also about offering a space to interact with new people, relevant to the very field you are working in while it’s not necessary for it to be a social event.</p>
<p>Events focusing on such aspects have grown around us, as they realise the importance of ‘community development’ and their further benefit from fruitful learning experience between the audience itself too.</p>
<p>Different organisations who desire to branch out themselves to different industries tend to organise events where they can advertise the co-dependency of two sects within the market and hence create a space for people to know each other and promote further growth.</p>
<p>Inviting eminent personalities specialising in certain field of interest and relevant to the professionals in making at various universities, to give talks and share experience is very much in- trend nowadays.</p>
<p>‘Your net worth is your Network’ is a quote that comes into play when one enters the corporate world. Students have started creating a before-hand experience by forming groups and using the social media platforms for their own benefits by building their presence and networking through such events and platforms.</p>
<p><strong>BLENDING IDEAS AND EXPERIENCES</strong></p>
<p>After attending various events, you unfold the different levels of organisational tools and inputs it takes to make an event engaging.</p>
<p>A cultural event at a tech college will never limit itself to entertainment but the infusion of tech-based entertainment. Mood Indigo at IIT Bombay shows such features very evidently through its events and exhibitions, showcasing the tech part which opens them to a variety of potential audience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalnexus.biz/jashn-e-rekhta-2018/">Jashn-e-rekhta</a>, on the other hand, has a very focused audience which keeps interest in a particular culture and specified form of literature. The organisers’ focus on reviving the tradition, celebrating the essence of Urdu and inviting people to attend plethora of experiences.</p>
<p>The Canton Fair (China Import and Export Fair) is another broad-spectrum example which actually focuses on truly everything. With 190,000 buyers per session and half of them being from different countries shows how as big the event gets, it not only should be engaging and must have something new to offer every next year, but also requires essential organisation of different phases through the whole event.</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE THINKING</strong></p>
<p>Our seniors demand,<br />
our attendees want,<br />
our sponsors crave,<br />
something ‘different’.</p>
<p>It’s no more a crowd but pool of opportunity that attends the event where you put all your efforts into. While smart work is more or less a working ethic nowadays, the marketing and design inputs wrap the deal in velvet ribbon.</p>
<p>‘Aesthetic’, as the millennials might call it, which adds up to the whole theme, is what we are talking about here.&nbsp;Events were organised yesterday and will continue to exist around us.But as potential audience, <strong>what catches our eyes, meets our soul.</strong></p>
<p>Also, in this fast-moving world our most valuable commodity continues to be the same old ‘time’. Incorporating any event within the comfort zone of both the ends, enables it to be a successful event.</p>
<p>a. The term ‘BROWN BAG SESSIONS’ not only urges you to know more about it but also attracts you after you actually understand the concept itself. It is a cross between a lecture and a lunch. The whole concept can have a two-fold perspective when we join the very first point by taking the lecture online.</p>
<p>b. GROUP LIGHTNING TALK is to pick a theme and instead of doing one long talk, have a number of lightning talks which helps in highlighting more community members that might be reluctant to do a long talk and summarise the point of it avoiding monotonous tone.</p>
<p>The idea here is to <strong>sound catchy, look innovative</strong> and <strong>feel impressive</strong> on the first go.</p>
<p>The opportunities are endless. Evolving nature of events to take the boredom out of the room can be a deal breaker for both attendees and the organisers.</p>

<p><strong> Arey Tukka Maar Koi , Ya Koi Teer Maar</strong></p>
<p><strong> Karle Jugaad Karle, Karle Koi Jugaad”</strong></p>
<p>Innovation is the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. Through our new initiative “Jugaad Campaign” we will give a platform to the interested participants to showcase their innovation. It will be organised at different levels and the participants will be rewarded with certificates. Also the best innovators selected by the panel of judges will be supported in the form of funding and will be mentored to become successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to promote and provide support to the many grassroots innovations that emerge from India’s informal sectors (schools &amp; colleges). Through this we will be serving a platform for the promotion of excellent Innovations, start-up businesses and other self-employment activities. When brought together, these myriads of small efforts will contribute to a larger trend of national innovation.</p>
